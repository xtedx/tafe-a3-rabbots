#offline start scene
is the starting scene when we launch the application
the list of available servers are shown to the client, or we can host a new game

#online lobby
is where the players are together waiting for the host to start the game.
here they can change their own name and colour
like how among us works.
only the host can start the game, choosing map 1 or map 2

#map 1
this will be loaded after the game is started by the host
the timer will be displayed at the top
health bars will be rendered

#map 2
another map, works like map 1
